    #  Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

    # Example 1:

    # Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
    # Output: 1
    # Explanation: 
    # There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
    # [1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
    # [0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
    # [0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
    # The minimum is 1.
    # Example 2:

    # Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
    # Output: 0
    # Explanation: 
    # Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.
    # Example 3:

    # Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: 
    # One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
    # Example 4:

    # Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1]
    # Output: 8
